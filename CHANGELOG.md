## Bug fixes

* Fix panic when using incorrect globs for file and type selections.

## New features

* Also replace `Ada_Case` (also known as `Mixed_Case`) variants when using `--subvert`

## New output

The output has changed, going from:
```
# Using version < 0.6
Patching foo/bar.js
--- old is old
+++ new is new
```

to:

```
# Using version >= 0.6
foo/bar.js:3 - old is old
foo/bar.js:3 + new is new
```
* ruplacer now displays the path and line number of each line that changed
* the coloring of patches is more precise. See #15 for details.
* ruplacer reports the total number of replacements, rather than the
  number of lines that changed

## Internal changes

* Drop dependency on the `difference` crate
* Improve public API
* Default branch is now called `main`
